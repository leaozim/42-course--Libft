# Libft

## Introduction

LIBFT is a project aimed at learning how C functions work, implementing them and understanding how to use them.

To run it I needed to learn about:
  C base;
  pointers;
  Memory allocation;
  Operations with basic data structure.

* **Mandatory part:** In the mandatory part, a set of functions from the LIBC file were redone, having the same prototypes and behaviors as the original ones. In addition to them, a set of functions were developed that are not in LIBC, or that are part of it, but in a different way.
* **Bonus part:** In the bonus functions were made to manipulate lists.
